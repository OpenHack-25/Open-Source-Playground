1. **Start Small** – Don’t set huge goals at once. Begin with small tasks (e.g., code 20 minutes daily instead of 5 hours).
2. **Build a Routine** – Fix a specific time daily for your work; consistency loves routine.
3. **Use the 2-Minute Rule** – If you feel lazy, just start with 2 minutes; most of the time, you’ll keep going.
4. **Set Clear, Achievable Goals** – Break big projects into small milestones and celebrate small wins.
5. **Track Progress** – Use a journal, calendar, or app to mark each day you stay consistent. Seeing streaks motivates.
6. **Remove Distractions** – Keep your workspace clean, silence notifications, and focus deeply.
7. **Stay Accountable** – Share your goals with a friend/mentor or join a community to keep yourself on track.
8. **Reward Yourself** – After completing tasks consistently, treat yourself (small snack, break, or activity you enjoy).
9. **Don’t Aim for Perfection** – Focus on progress, not perfection. Missing one day is okay—just don’t miss two in a row.
10. **Discipline > Motivation** – Motivation comes and goes, but discipline keeps you consistent. Train yourself to work even when not in the mood.
