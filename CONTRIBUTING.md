## üìñ Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Fork the Repository
1. Go to the [Open Source Playground repository](https://github.com/OpenHack-25/Open-Source-Playground)
2. Click the "Fork" button in the top-right corner
3. This creates your own copy of the repository

### Step 2: Clone Your Fork
```bash
# Replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Open-Source-Playground.git
cd Open-Source-Playground
```

### Step 3: Create a New Branch 
(note: Tip: Branch names should be short and descriptive, like fix-typo-readme or add-js-example.)
```bash
# Use a descriptive branch name
git checkout -b add-my-name
# or
git checkout -b add-python-calculator
# or  
git checkout -b fix-readme-typo
```

### Step 4: Make Your Changes

#### Adding Yourself to CONTRIBUTORS.md
1. Open `CONTRIBUTORS.md`
2. Find the "Add your name above this line!" comment
3. Add your information following this format:
```markdown
### [Mahnoor Shuaib ](https://github.com/Mahnoor-shuaib)
- **Fun Fact**: my code works after alot of errors !
- **Favorite Programming Language**: java OOP
- **Location**: Your city/country (optional)
- **First Contribution Date**: 2025-10-01
```

#### Adding a Code Example
1. Navigate to the appropriate language folder in `examples/`
2. If your language folder doesn't exist, create it:
   ```bash
   mkdir examples/your-language
   ```
3. Add your program file with a descriptive name
4. Include comments explaining what the code does

### Step 5: Test Your Changes
- If you added code, make sure it runs without errors
- Check that file formatting looks good
- Verify links work in markdown files

### Step 6: Commit Your Changes
```bash
# Add your changes
git add .

# Commit with a clear message
git commit -m "Add John Doe to contributors list"
# or
git commit -m "Add Python hello world example"
# or
git commit -m "Fix typo in README.md"
```

### Step 7: Push to Your Fork
```bash
git push origin your-branch-name
```

### Step 8: Create a Pull Request
1. Go to your fork on GitHub
2. Click "Compare & pull request"
3. Fill out the pull request template:
   - **Title**: Clear, descriptive title
   - **Description**: Explain what you changed and why
4. Click "Create pull request"

## üìù Code Guidelines

### File Naming
- Use lowercase with hyphens: `hello-world.py`, `simple-calculator.js`
- Be descriptive: `fibonacci-sequence.cpp` instead of `fib.cpp`

### Code Style
- **Include comments**: Explain what your code does
- **Keep it simple**: Focus on readability over complexity
- **Add a header comment**: Include your name and what the program does

### Example Header Format
```python
# Hello World in Python
# Author: Your Name
# Description: A simple program that prints "Hello, World!"

print("Hello, World!")
```

### Documentation
- **README files**: Add a README.md in language folders explaining how to run the code
- **Clear instructions**: Assume the reader is a beginner
- **Examples**: Show expected output

## üîÑ Pull Request Process

### What Happens After You Submit?
1. **Automatic checks**: Basic validations run automatically
2. **Review**: Maintainers will review your contribution
3. **Feedback**: You might receive suggestions for improvements
4. **Merge**: Once approved, your changes will be merged!

### PR Requirements
- ‚úÖ Clear title and description
- ‚úÖ Code works and is tested
- ‚úÖ Follows project guidelines

- Make requested changes in your existing branch
- Push changes to automatically update the PR

## üÜò Getting Help

### Common Issues

**"I can't push to the repository"**
- Make sure you're pushing to your fork, not the original repository
- Check that you're on the correct branch

**"My pull request has merge conflicts"**
- This happens when the main branch has changed since you started
- Ask for help in the pull request comments - we're happy to guide you!

**"I made a mistake in my commit"**
- Don't worry! You can make additional commits to fix issues
- Or ask for help to learn about `git commit --amend`

### Where to Ask for Help
- **GitHub Issues**: Open an issue with the "help wanted" label
- **Pull Request Comments**: Ask questions directly in your PR
- **Community Discussions**: Use GitHub Discussions for general questions
